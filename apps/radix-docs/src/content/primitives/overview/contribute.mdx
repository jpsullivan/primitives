## Contributing workflow

- Decide on what you want to contribute.
- If you would like to implement a new feature, discuss it with the maintainer [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/radix-ng/discussions/new/choose) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/NaJb2XRWX9)) before jumping into coding.
- After finalizing issue details, you can begin working on the code.
- If you cannot finish your task or if you change your mind – that's totally fine! Just let us know in the GitHub issue that you created during the first step of this process. The Radix-NG community is friendly – we won't judge or ask any questions if you decide to cancel your submission.
