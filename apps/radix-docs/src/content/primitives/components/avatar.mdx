## API Reference

### Image
`RdxAvatarImageDirective`

The image to render.
By default it will only render when it has loaded. You can use the `onLoadingStatusChange` handler if you need more control.

<PropsTable name="RdxAvatarImageDirective" />

### Fallback
`RdxAvatarFallbackDirective`

An element that renders when the image hasn't loaded. This means whilst it's loading, or if there was an error.
If you notice a flash during loading, you can provide a `delayMs` prop to delay its rendering
so it only renders for those with slower connections.

For more control, use the `onLoadingStatusChange` handler on `rdxAvatarImage`.
